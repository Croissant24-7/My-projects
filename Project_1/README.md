**Project description**

An archive of real estate ads of several years in Saint-Petersburg and surrounding towns is available. Our goal - to perform data preprocessing and explore it to detect features and relations on the market. There are two types of data for each apartment: added by users (e.g. square, floor, amount of balconies) and cartographic (e.g. distance from the city centre, the airport and the nearest park).
