**Project description**

We work with a startup, which sells grocery. We should inspect app users behaviour.
Our task is to:
- explore a sales funnel;
- figure out, how users proceed to purchase;
- detect, how many users proceed to purchase and how many stuck on previous steps.

After that we should analyze the A/A/B-experiment results - users were divided into 3 groups: 2 control groups with old font and 1 experimental - with new one.

Let's find out, which font is better.
