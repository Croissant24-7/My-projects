**Project description**

We operate as an online-store that sells videogames worlwide. We've retrieved retrospective videogames data related to sales, users and critic scores, genres, platforms.
Our goal is to detect patterns that determine success of a videogame. Thus we'll be able to define a potentially popular product and to plan effective marketing campaign for next year. We should work out the principles of data handling and analysis.
